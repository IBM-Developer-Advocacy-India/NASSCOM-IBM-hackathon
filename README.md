### FAQ

#### 1\. What is Call for Code?

Call for Code asks innovators to create practical, effective, and high-quality applications based on one or more IBM Cloud™ services (for example, web, mobile, data, analytics, AI, IoT, or weather) that can have an immediate and lasting impact on humanitarian issues. Teams of developers, data scientists, designers, business analysts, subject matter experts and more are challenged to build solutions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and climate change.

This year the competition will have two tracks. One track is for solutions that help halt and reverse the impact of climate change. The second track is for solutions to mitigate the impact of global pandemics like COVID-19 on communities around the world. Winning solutions are deployed in communities that need the most help.

#### 2\. What is the Virtual Hackathon and How will it affect my chances of participation in the global challenge?

Every year as a part of the global challenge, we organize regional hackathons for India where teams are mentored by seasoned developer advocates from IBM. Similarly, this event is a subsidiary of the global challenge. But as you know with the recent increase in the number of cases for COVID-19 and light of the measures declared by our Government for a 21 days lockdown, we are taking the challenge to your doorstep virtually.

With the Call for Code India Hackathon, you will be able to get in touch with developers who are at the heart of technology every day, you will be able to refine and send in a matured submission with an increased chance of getting to the finish line.

#### 3\. Do I need to pay any money to register for the Hackathon?

No. You do not have to pay anything to anyone to register yourself for hackathon. It is free of cost.

#### 4\. Where do I get assistance for this hackathon? Is there a platform where I can post my queries, discuss and get assistance?

You can post your queries in the discussion forum to reach out to IBM developer advocates on this Slack Channel #prayudh and join [here.](https://www.bit.ly/ibm-dev)

#### 5\. Will I need to do a separate submission to the global challenge?

As stated earlier, this challenge submissions will only be considered for the Call for Code India Virtual Hack. You will need to create a separate submission to the global challenge as given in the portal. [https://callforcode.org/submit/](https://callforcode.org/submit/)

### Judgement Criteria

Submissions will be judged equally across 4 primary criteria which evaluate whether the solution solves a real-world problem and uses technology effectively.

**Completeness and transferability**

How fully has the idea been implemented? Can it achieve an impact on the field? Can it be transferred elsewhere?

**Effectiveness and efficiency**

Does the solution address a high priority area? Does it achieve its goal effectively and efficiently? Can it scale?

**Design and usability**

How good are the design, user experience, and ease of use of the solution? How quickly can it be put to use?

**Creativity and innovation**

How unique was the approach to solving a long-standing or previously intractable problem?
